Then CUBIC on the server could burst up to 77kB (BDP) of data, it is a 5.9us burst on the 100GE link.\r\nThat is an additional 20ms burst for the client\u2019s shaper on BRAS or wireless AP that may be already loaded close to the maximum.\u201d\r\n<image005.png>\r\n\r\nIMHO: this fact is not stressed well enough in section 3.\r\nThe story of how 5.9us becomes 20ms is very important story.",

This function gets a new rtt sample, called mrtt_us.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 1: THERE IS A PREVIOUS SAMPLE:\r\n\r\nThe stored srtt_us is left-shifted by 3 bits (comment: \"/ smoothed round trip time << 3 in usecs /\"); thus the comment \"m is now error in rtt est\", in line 892, next to:\r\nm -= (srtt >> 3);\r\nis correct, i.e. m now really is the difference between srtt and the latest sample (mrtt_us).\r\n\r\nLet's look at the next line, srtt += m, with the comment:\r\n/* rtt = 7/8 rtt + 1/8 new */\r\n\r\nNote that the value of the \"srtt\" variable is actually the srtt << 3, i.e. times 8. So, using \"SRTT\" to represent srtt in the common meaning and RTT to represent the new RTT sample, this line translates into:\r\n\r\nSRTT = SRTT * 8 + (RTT-SRTT)\r\nwhich really is the same as:\r\nSRTT = SRTT * 7 + RTT\r\n\r\n... which is what the comment says, with the exception that the resulting SRTT value is 8 times too large (i.e., left-shifted by 3 bits), but that's how this value is stored in the end.\r\n\r\nNext, \"mdev\" and \"rttvar\" are updated... which are meaningful for RTO calculation but not for the SRTT directly. \r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 2: THERE IS NO PREVIOUS SAMPLE  (INIT.):\r\n\r\nSRTT is set to RTT (the measured time). In the code, really, it is set to \"m << 3\": before this, m is initialized to be the same as mrtt_us, and it's left-shifted by 3 bits because this is how the SRTT is really stored (srtt_us).\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally (in line 934), the code also sets a minimum value for SRTT, which is \"1\": this really represents 1/3 microseconds, I believe.\r\n",

For example a video coder that encodes video at 50 frames per second, outputs  a frame every 20ms. This frame is typically split up in MTU sized packets. Video coding typically also encodes frames of varying size, depending on the complexity of the input signal.  \nThis has the consequence that the packet pacing cannot be tuned to match the nominal bitrate, as this would mean that large video frames are unnecessarily delay on the sender side.\nSCReAM (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-johansson-ccwg-rfc8298bis-screamv2/ ) as an example paces, packets at a 50% higher rate than the nominal bitrate. This has the effect that an average video frame in the example above is transmitted in 20/1.5 = 13.3ms. This reduces the risk that video frames are delayed unnecesarily  other than when the video frame is unusually large.",

          "body": "pacing rate is calculated based on link bandwidth, in units of bytes/sec. Aggregation can still be achieved by allowing a min burst size per send call and this burst can be specified in units of time, for example Prague implementations currently use 250us. And then corresponding burst size can be calculated by multiplying pacing rate * burst (eg. burst size for 100MBps link would be (100MBps * .000250). This should allow transferring big AMPDUs at WiFi layer.\r\n\r\nNot pacing at all is not ideal for any type of traffic whether it is gaming or video. I think pacing is a good goal universally, its just how it is done can be different from use case to use case. Some apps might do pacing at 100%, some might do at a lower rate and some might do at a higher rate. Also, a single app might choose to do pacing at different rates at different times.\r\n\r\nRegarding, lower layer aggregation, I agree that can be counter productive to pacing. Product companies should invest time to reduce queuing and hence aggregation in lower layers. Nokia with their L4S capable WiFi has shown that low queuing and the correct amount of aggregation can be achieved in WiFi.\r\n",

A static web transfer is limited by the Flow Completion Time (FCT), i.e. we want as high throughput as possible for this application and don't actually care about queuing. Interactive traffic is very different.\n\nSo, it all depends on the type of application - but, luckily, a simple time-based rule such as the Prague one you mention will probably do the right thing automatically, under all circumstances.",

Just some suggestions:\r\n\r\n```suggestion\r\nApplications or congestion control mechanisms can produce bursty traffic which can cause unnecessary queuing and packet loss. To reduce the burstiness of traffic, the concept of evenly spacing out the traffic from a data sender over a round-trip time known as Pacing has been used in many transport protocol implementations. This document gives an overview of Pacing and how some known Pacing implementations work.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's why I make these suggestions:\r\n- Congestion control mechanisms \"and applications\" because, well, that's the truth. If I write an app over UDP, with or without CC, my traffic can be bursty or not.\r\n- I didn't understand the point of \"when used alone in transport protocols\", so I suggest removing that.\r\n- I suggest removing the \"higher\" comparison in the first sentence because it makes me ask \"higher than what?\".\r\n- The \"such\" in \"such traffic\" also makes me want to ask \"what traffic are you talking about\"?  Congestion controlled traffic only?  Anyway \"such\" just seems unnecessary to me here.\r\n- \"also known as Pacing\" - I think it's just known as Pacing, that's the word for it. No need for \"also\".",

This limits the sender's transmission rate at the granularity of a round-trip time (RTT). If the sender transmits the entire cwnd sized data in an instant, this can results in unnecessarily high queuing and eventually packet losses at the bottleneck. Such consequences are detrimental to users' applications in terms of both responsiveness and goodput. To solve this problem, the concept of pacing was introduced. Pacing allows to send the same cwnd sized data but spread it across a round-trip time more evenly.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"more evenly\" (across the rtt) is important, IMO, because at least Linux in slow start does not necessarily spread them \"across the RTT evenly\" for several rounds  (does Apple?  Note that cwnd changes when ACKs come - so the basic Linux logic of delaying with cwnd/rtt does *not* produce an even spread across the RTT when cwnd changes significantly with arriving ACKs).\r\n\r\nI suggest removing the \"resulting in a more even use\" because, first, \"a more even use\" seems imprecise, and second, the next paragraph goes into more details on the benefits anyway.",

Accordingly, it is in line with these specifications to pace packets. Pacing is known to have advantages -- if some packets arrive at a bottleneck as a burst (all packets being back-to-back), loss can be more likely to happen than in a case where there are time gaps between packets (e.g., when they are spread out over the RTT). It also means that pacing is less likely to cause any sudden, ephemeral increases in queuing delay. Since keeping the queues short reduces packet losses, pacing is more likely to yield higher goodput by reducing the time lost in loss recovery.\r\n```",

While standard QUIC congestion control {{RFC9002}} is based on TCP Reno, which is not defined to include pacing (but also does not prohibit it), QUIC congestion control requires either pacing or some other burst limitation ({{Section 7.7 of RFC9002}}).  BBR congestion control implementations are common in QUIC stacks, and pacing is integral to BBR, so this document focuses on it.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbout NewReno: 1) Yuchung keeps making the point that NewReno (as opposed to Reno) is just a difference in the recovery, not a \"new congestion control\", and I agree with him. I think it's called \"newreno\" as a choice in Linux, but let's keep RFCs clean and talk about Reno.  2) about \"not precluding\", I'm suggesting this change because else it might get confusing with other sections - e.g. Linux' pacing is applied to Reno.\r\n\r\nAbout the curly brackets: I learned this from one of the IESG reviews in TAPS, this actually works.",

I have gotten so used to IW being sent without pacing (in Linux) that, seeing these 4ms, I just thought \"this is probably timing noise\". But 4ms would be way too large for that anyway. It was just me - all is well, the example is good as it stands!",
