Just some suggestions:\r\n\r\n```suggestion\r\nApplications or congestion control mechanisms can produce bursty traffic which can cause unnecessary queuing and packet loss. To reduce the burstiness of traffic, the concept of evenly spacing out the traffic from a data sender over a round-trip time known as Pacing has been used in many transport protocol implementations. This document gives an overview of Pacing and how some known Pacing implementations work.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's why I make these suggestions:\r\n- Congestion control mechanisms \"and applications\" because, well, that's the truth. If I write an app over UDP, with or without CC, my traffic can be bursty or not.\r\n- I didn't understand the point of \"when used alone in transport protocols\", so I suggest removing that.\r\n- I suggest removing the \"higher\" comparison in the first sentence because it makes me ask \"higher than what?\".\r\n- The \"such\" in \"such traffic\" also makes me want to ask \"what traffic are you talking about\"?  Congestion controlled traffic only?  Anyway \"such\" just seems unnecessary to me here.\r\n- \"also known as Pacing\" - I think it's just known as Pacing, that's the word for it. No need for \"also\".",

              "body": "```suggestion\r\nRFCs describing congestion control generally refer to congestion window (cwnd) as an upper limit for the number of unacknowledged packets a sender is allowed to emit. This limits the sender's transmission rate at the granularity of a round-trip time (RTT). If the sender transmits the entire cwnd sized data in an instant, this can results in unnecessarily high queuing and eventually packet losses at the bottleneck. Such consequences are detrimental to users' applications in terms of both responsiveness and goodput. To solve this problem, the concept of pacing was introduced. Pacing allows to send the same cwnd sized data but spread it across a round-trip time more evenly.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"more evenly\" (across the rtt) is important, IMO, because at least Linux in slow start does not necessarily spread them \"across the RTT evenly\" for several rounds  (does Apple?  Note that cwnd changes when ACKs come - so the basic Linux logic of delaying with cwnd/rtt does *not* produce an even spread across the RTT when cwnd changes significantly with arriving ACKs).\r\n\r\nI suggest removing the \"resulting in a more even use\" because, first, \"a more even use\" seems imprecise, and second, the next paragraph goes into more details on the benefits anyway.",

              "body": "```suggestion\r\nCongestion control specifications always allow to send less than the cwnd, or temporarily emit packets at a lower rate. Accordingly, it is in line with these specifications to pace packets. Pacing is known to have advantages -- if some packets arrive at a bottleneck as a burst (all packets being back-to-back), loss can be more likely to happen than in a case where there are time gaps between packets (e.g., when they are spread out over the RTT). It also means that pacing is less likely to cause any sudden, ephemeral increases in queuing delay. Since keeping the queues short reduces packet losses, pacing is more likely to yield higher goodput by reducing the time lost in loss recovery.\r\n```",
