                     Pacing in Transport Protocols
                    draft-welzl-iccrg-pacing-latest

Abstract

   Applications or congestion control mechanisms can produce bursty
   traffic which can cause unnecessary queuing and packet loss.  To
   reduce the burstiness of traffic, the concept of evenly spacing out
   the traffic from a data sender over a round-trip time known as
   "pacing" has been used in many transport protocol implementations.
   This document gives an overview of pacing and how some known pacing
   implementations work.

1.  Introduction

   Applications commonly generate either bulk data (e.g. files) or
   bursts of data (e.g. segments of media) that transport protocols
   deliver into the network based on congestion control algorithms.

   RFCs describing congestion control generally refer to a congestion
   window (cwnd) state variable as an upper limit for either the number
   of unacknowledged packets or bytes that a sender is allowed to emit.
   This limits the sender's transmission rate at the granularity of a
   round-trip time (RTT).  If the sender transmits the entire cwnd sized
   data in an instant, this can result in unnecessarily high queuing and
   eventually packet losses at the bottleneck.  Such consequences are
   detrimental to users' applications in terms of both responsiveness
   and goodput.  To solve this problem, the concept of pacing was
   introduced.  Pacing allows to send the same cwnd sized data but
   spread it across a round-trip time more evenly.

   Congestion control specifications always allow to send less than the
   cwnd, or temporarily emit packets at a lower rate.  Accordingly, it
   is in line with these specifications to pace packets.  Pacing is
   known to have advantages -- if some packets arrive at a bottleneck as
   a burst (all packets being back-to-back), loss can be more likely to
   happen than in a case where there are time gaps between packets
   (e.g., when they are spread out over the RTT).  It also means that
   pacing is less likely to cause any sudden, ephemeral increases in
   queuing delay.  Since keeping the queues short reduces packet losses,
   pacing can also yield higher goodput by reducing the time lost in
   loss recovery.

   Because of its known advantages, pacing has become common in
   implementations of congestion controlled transports.  It is also an
   integral element of the "BBR" congestion control mechanism
   [I-D.cardwell-iccrg-bbr-congestion-control].

   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Pacing: general considerations and consequences

3.1.  More likely to saturate a bottleneck

   We can distinguish between two reasons for packet losses that are due
   to congestion at a bottleneck with a DropTail (FIFO) queue:

   1.  A flight of N packets arrives.  The amount of data in this flight
       exceeds the amount of data that can be transmitted by the
       bottleneck during the flight's arrival plus the queue length,
       i.e. some data do not fit into the queue.

   2.  The bottleneck is fully saturated.  The queue is full, and
       packets drain from it more slowly than new packets arrive.

   The second type of loss matches the typical expectation of a
   congestion control algorithm: the cwnd value when loss happens is
   indicative of the bottleneck being fully saturated.  When the first
   type of loss happens, however, a sender's cwnd can be much smaller
   than the Bandwidth*Delay Product (BDP) of the path (the amount of
   data that can be in flight, ignoring the queue).  In the absence of
   other traffic, the probability for the first type of loss to happen
   depends on the queue length and the ratio between the departure and
   the arrival rate during the flight's arrival.  By introducing time
   gaps between the packets of a burst, this ratio is increased, i.e.
   the difference between the departure and the arrival rate becomes
   smaller, and the second type of loss is more likely.

   For example, consider a network path with a bottleneck capacity of 50
   Mbit/s, a queue length of 15000 bytes (or 10 packets of size 1500
   bytes) and an RTT of 30 ms.  Assume that all packets emitted by the
   sender have a size of 1500 bytes.  Then, the BDP equals 125 packets.
   The bottleneck of this network path is fully saturated when a (BDP +
   queue length) amount of bytes are in flight: 135 packets.

   In this network, the first type of loss can happen as follows: say,
   N=40 packets arrive at this bottleneck at a rate of 100 Mbit/s.  In
   an otherwise empty network and assuming an initial window of 10
   packets and no delayed ACKs, this occurs in the third round of slow
   start without pacing, provided that the capacities of all links
   before the bottleneck are at least 100 Mbit/s.  In this case, an
   overshoot will occur: packets are forwarded with half their arrival
   rate, i.e. less than 20 packets can be forwarded during the burst's
   arrival.  The remaining 20 (or more) packets cannot fit into the
   10-packet queue.  A cwnd of 40 packets is much smaller than the (BDP
   + queue) limit of 135 packets, and the bottleneck is not fully
   saturated.

   Let us now assume that the flight of 40 packets is instead paced,
   such that the arrival rate only mildly exceeds the departure rate --
   e.g., they arrive at a rate of 60 Mbit/s.  When the last packet of
   this flight arrives at the bottleneck, the bottleneck should already
   have forwarded 5/6 * 39 = 32.5 packets.  Since only complete packets
   can be sent, the bottleneck has really forwarded 32 packets, and the
   remaining 40-32 = 8 packets fit in the queue.  No loss occurs.

   This example explains how pacing can enable a rate increase to last
   longer than without pacing.  This makes it more likely that a
   bottleneck is saturated, such that cwnd reflects the BDP plus the
   queue length (loss type 2).

3.1.1.  Backing off after the increase

   The two loss types explained in Section 3.1 require a different back-
   off factor to allow the queue to drain and congestion to dissipate.
   Specifically, in the single-sender single-bottleneck example above,
   when a slow start overshoot occurs as loss type 2, a back-off
   function such as: ssthresh = cwnd * beta with beta >= 0.5 is
   guaranteed to cause a second loss after the end of loss recovery.
   This is because, when cwnd exceeds a fully saturated bottleneck
   (i.e., cwnd > BDP + queue length), cwnd will have grown further by
   another (BDP + queue length) by the time the sender learns about the
   loss.  In this case, beta = 0.5 will cause ssthresh to exceed (BDP +
   queue length) again.

   Since pacing makes loss type 2 more likely, beta < 0.5 may be a
   better choice after slow start overshoot when pacing is used.

3.1.2.  Able to work with smaller queues

   The probability of loss type 1 in Section 3.1 is indirectly
   proportional to the queue length.  Pacing therefore enables a rate
   increase to continue with a smaller queue at the bottleneck than in
   the case without pacing.

3.2.  Getting good RTT estimates

   Since pacing algorithms generally attempt to spread out packets
   evenly across an RTT, it is important to have a good RTT estimate.
   Especially in the beginning of a transfer, when sending the initial
   window, the only RTT estimate available may be from the connection
   establishment handshake.  Being based on only one sample, this is a
   very unreliable estimate, and using it to pace the initial window can
   cause unnecessary delay.  This may be the reason why the Linux TCP
   implementation does not pace the first 10 packets (see Section 4.1).
   As a possible improvement, the initial RTT estimate could also be
   based on a previous connection (temporal sharing) or on another
   ongoing connection (ensemble sharing) [RFC9040].

4.  Implementation examples

4.1.  Linux TCP

   The following description is based on Linux kernel version 6.8.9.

   There are two ways to enable pacing in Linux: 1) via a socket option,
   2) by configuring the FQ queue discipline.  We describe case 1.

   Independent of the value of the Initial Window (IW), the first 10
   (hardcoded) packets are not paced.  Later, 10 packets will generally
   be sent without pacing every 2^32 packets.

   Every time an ACK arrives, a pacing rate is calculated, as: factor *
   MSS * cwnd / SRTT, where "factor" is a configurable value that, by
   default, is 2 in slow start and 1.2 in congestion avoidance.  MSS is
   the sender maximum segment size [RFC5681], and SRTT is the smoothed
   round-trip time [RFC6298] [TODO check: Linux calculates SRTT
   different from the standard, though RFC 6298 relaxes the rules, so
   maybe it's ok?]  The sender transmits data in line with the
   calculated pacing rate; this is approximated by calculating the rate
   per millisecond, and generally sending the resulting amount of data
   per millisecond as a small burst, every millisecond.  As an
   exception, the per-millisecond amount of data can be a little larger
   when the peer is very close, depending on a configurable value (per
   default, when the minimum RTT is less than 3 milliseconds).

   If the pacing rate is smaller than 2 packets per millisecond, these
   bursts will become 2 packets in size, and they will not be sent every
   millisecond but with a varying time delay (depending on the pacing
   rate).  If the pacing rate is larger than 64 Kbyte per millisecond,
   these bursts will be 64 Kbyte in size, and they will not be sent
   every millisecond but with a varying time delay (depending on the
   pacing rate).  Bursts can always be smaller than described above, or
   be "nothing", if a limiting factor such as the receiver window (rwnd)
   [RFC5681] or the current cwnd disallows transmission.  If the
   previous packet was not sent when expected by the pacing logic, but
   more than half of a pacing gap ago (e.g., due to a cwnd limitation),
   the pacing gap is halved.

4.2.  Apple OSes

   Pacing was added to Apple OS as a private API in iOS 17 and macOS 14.
   In its current form, an application or transport protocol computes
   and sets the desired transmit timestamp on a per packet basis and
   sends it to the pacing module in AQM.  The packets are queued in the
   AQM until the current time becomes greater than or equal to
   corresponding packet's transmit timestamp.  There is an upper limit
   of 3 seconds for how long the AQM will hold a queued packet before
   sending it.

   The above simplicity in the kernel allows upper layer protocols or
   applications to set a transmit timestamp in a manner that is suitable
   for them.  For example, a stream based protocol like TCP might pace
   packets differently than a video conferencing app.

4.3.  FreeBSD

   FreeBSD has the infrastructure to support multiple TCP stacks.  Each
   TCP stack has a tcp_output() function, which handles most of the
   sending of TCP segments.  The default stack does not support pacing
   and its tcp_output() may be called whenever

   1.  a TCP segment is received or

   2.  a TCP timer (like the retransmission or delayed ACK timer) runs
       off or

   3.  the application provides new data to be sent

   and sends as many TCP segments as is allowed by the congestion and
   flow control resulting in burst of TCP segments.  However, this also
   allows to make use of TCP Segment Offload (TSO), which reduces the
   CPU load.

   The RACK [RACK] and BBR stacks both support pacing by leveraging the
   TCP High Precision Timer System (HPTS) [HPTS], which is a kernel
   loadable module available in FreeBSD 14 and higher.  The tcp_output()
   function of a TCP stack which supports pacing will not send as much
   as is allowed by congestion and flow control, but may only send a
   micro burst and schedule itself for being called after the inter-
   burst send time using the HPTS.  The RACK stack supports an
   application setting a pacing rate and a maximum burst size using TCP
   socket options.  The RACK stack then uses these values to compute the
   actual micro burst size and the inter-burst send time.

   The HPTS is optimized for handling a large number of TCP connections
   and the tcp_output() function of the RACK stack is also optimized for
   being called more often than the tcp_output() function of the default
   stack.  This allows to use TSO in combination with TCP pacing.

   This subsystem underpins recently published research by Netflix and
   Stanford into application-informed pacing at scale [Sammy].

4.4.  QUIC BBR implementations

   Pacing capability is expected in QUIC senders.  While standard QUIC
   congestion control [RFC9002] is based on TCP Reno, which is not
   defined to include pacing (but also does not prohibit it), QUIC
   congestion control requires either pacing or some other burst
   limitation (Section 7.7 of [RFC9002]).  BBR congestion control
   implementations are common in QUIC stacks, and pacing is integral to
   BBR, so this document focuses on it.

   Pacing in QUIC stacks commonly involves:

   1.  Access to lower-level (e.g.  OS and hardware) capabilities needed
       for effective pacing.

   2.  Managing additional timers related to pacing, along with those
       already needed for retransmission, and other events.

   3.  Details of the actual pacing algorithm (e.g. granularity of
       bursts allowed, etc.).

   Examples of different approaches to dealing with these challenges in
   ways that work on multiple operating systems and hardware platforms
   can be found in open source QUIC stacks, such as Google's QUIC
   implementation and Meta's "mvfst".  These provide examples for some
   of the concepts discussed below.

   Unlike TCP implementations that typically run within the operating
   system kernel, QUIC implementations more typically run in user space
   and are thus faced with more challenges regarding timing and coupling
   with the underlying protocol stack and hardware needed to achieve
   pacing.  For instance, if an application trying to do pacing is
   running on a highly loaded system, it may often "wake up late" and
   miss the times that it intends to pace packets.

   When a large amount of data needs to be sent, pacing naively could
   result in an excessive number of timers to be managed and adjusted
   along with all of the other timers that the QUIC stack and rest of
   the application require.  The Hashed Hierarchical Timing Wheel [VL87]
   provides one approach for such cases, but implementations may also
   simply schedule the next send event based on the current pacing rate,
   and then schedule subsequent events as needed, rather than adjusting
   timers for them.  In any case, typically a pacing algorithm should
   allow for some amount of burstiness, in order to efficiently use the
   hardware as well as to be responsive for bursty (but low overall
   rate) applications, and to avoid excessive timer management.

   Pacing can be done based on different approaches such as a token-
   based or tokenless algorithm.  For instance, a tokenless algorithm
   (e.g. as used in mvfst) might compute a regular interval time and
   batch size (number of packets) to be released every interval and
   achieve the pacing rate.  This allows specific future transmissions
   to be scheduled.  In contrast, a token-based algorithm accumulates
   tokens to permit transmission based on the pacing rate, using a
   "leaky bucket" to control bursts.  In this case the size of bursts
   may be more granular, depending on how much time has elapsed between
   evaluations.

   The additional notion of "burst tokens" (or other burst allowance)
   may be present in order to rapidly transmit data if coming out of a
   quiescent period (e.g. when a flow has been application-limited
   without data to send, e.g. as used in Google's implementation).  A
   number of burst tokens, representing packets that can be sent
   unpaced, is initialized to some value (e.g. 10) when a flow starts or
   becomes quiescent.  If burst tokens are available, outgoing packets
   are sent immediately, without pacing, up to the limit permitted by
   the congestion window, and the burst tokens are depleted by each
   packet sent.  The number of burst tokens is reduced to zero on
   congestion events.  When coming out of quiescence, it is set to the
   minimum of the initial burst size, or the amount of packets that the
   congestion window (in bytes) represents.

   There may be additional "lumpy tokens" that further allow unpaced
   packets after the burst tokens have been consumed, and the congestion
   window does not limit sending.  The amount of lumpy tokens that might
   be present is determined using heuristics, generally limiting to a
   small number of packets (e.g. 1 or 2).

5.  Security Considerations

   While congestion control designs, including aspects such as pacing,
   could result in unwanted competing traffic, they do not directly
   result in new security considerations.

   Transport protocols that provide authentication (including those
   using encryption), or are carried over protocols that provide
   authentication, can protect their congestion control algorithm from
   network attack.  This is orthogonal to the congestion control rules.

6.  IANA Considerations
