                    draft-welzl-iccrg-pacing-latest

Abstract

   Pacing, the practice of introducing delay in between packets that are
   emitted by a data sender, has long been a common practice in
   transport protocol implementations.  This document gives an overview
   of how some known pacing implementations work.
